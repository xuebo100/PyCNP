Installation instructions
=========================

The most straightforward way to use the ``pycnp`` package is to install via *pip*:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pycnp


Installing from source
----------------------

To install the latest version of ``pycnp`` directly from the GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install 'pycnp @ git+https://github.com/xuebo100/PyCNP'

This can be useful to get updates that have not yet been released to the Python package index.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python 3.9 or higher
* A C++ compiler with C++20 support (for building from source)
