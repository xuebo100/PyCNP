"""
Statistics module.

Provides the :class:`Statistics` class for collecting and managing iteration
metrics during a MemeticSearch run.

This module tracks runtime, best objective value, population size, and idle
generation counts for each iteration, enabling post-hoc analysis of algorithm
performance.

Classes
-------
Statistics
    Collects and manages iteration statistics during search execution.
_IterationStats
    Internal dataclass storing statistics for a single iteration.
